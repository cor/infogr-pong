### Work division

We pair programmed the enitre application together. Cor did produce the actual sound files, and 
can be considered our lead designer. 

### Features

- Pong
- Scoring
- Letter rendering
- Score rendering
- Ball tail
- Interactive play button
- WebGL
- VueJS app + hosting
- VHS effect
- Screen curvature

Our entire game can be viewed [online](https://cor.github.io/infogr-pong) as well!

### Sources

Stack overflow sources are included in the actual code. We used snippets to determine mouse locations on the
html canvas, and [wessles](https://github.com/wessles/GLSL-CRT/blob/master/shader.frag) implementation of screen curvatures.  

Finally we used official OpenGL and WebGL tutorials to create the app, and previous work by us on the raytracer assignment as well.
